### Universal analysis of biomedical data

A program is used for statistical analysis of medical data in independent groups. At least two groups should be input, but no more than six. The tool considers qualitative as well as quantitative data. Columns should have titles and the first column should contain group names. File with the groups should contain CSV extension and the groups do not be mixed (one group first, then the next and so on).
